# DDPG-PyTorch
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient implemented in PyTorch for DeepMind Control Suite

This repository contains the code to implement the algorithm in the paper [Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf).
The algorithm presents a method to perform Q-learning in continuous action spaces. The code contains the implementation on
[DeepMind Control Suite](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) simulations.
